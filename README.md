A structured collection of C++ programs created during my college lectures.
This repository contains practice programs, assignments, and small academic projects used to understand the fundamentals and intermediate concepts of C++ programming.

The goal of maintaining this repository is to keep all lecture codes organized in one place so they can be easily revisited for revision, learning, and reference.

## Basic C++ Programs

Several small programs are included to understand fundamental programming concepts such as:

* Taking user input
* Performing calculations
* Using loops and conditions
* Practicing logical problem solving

Example program included in the repository:

* `reversestring.cpp` – demonstrates string manipulation and logic building.

---

## File Handling

The repository contains examples demonstrating how file operations work in C++.

Concepts practiced include:

* Creating files
* Writing data to files
* Reading data from files
* Basic file input and output operations

Example file:

* `FileHandling/intro.cpp`

---

## Sample Practice Programs

The `samplecpp` folder contains simple practice programs written during lectures to strengthen understanding of C++ syntax and logic.

Example files:

* `sample.cpp`
* `sample2.cpp`

These programs mainly focus on improving coding logic and program structure.

---

## Combined Lecture Programs

The folder **mis-(all_programs_combined)** contains a collection of various lecture programs grouped together for reference.
These include examples and exercises discussed in class across different sessions.

---

## Mini Projects

Some folders contain small academic projects and supporting resources created during coursework.

Example project:

Quiz Game Application

Project resources may include:

* C++ source code (`.cpp`)
* Documentation (`.docx`)
* Presentation slides (`.pptx`)
* Additional resources (`.zip`)

These projects were created to understand how programming concepts can be applied in real programs.

---

## How to Run the Programs

1. Install a C++ compiler such as **g++**.
2. Navigate to the folder containing the program.
3. Compile the program using the terminal.

```
g++ program.cpp -o program
```

4. Run the compiled program.

```
./program
```

## Purpose of This Repository

This repository serves several purposes:

* Keeping all lecture programs organized
* Helping with revision of programming concepts
* Practicing C++ coding and logic building
* Maintaining a record of academic programming work
* Tracking learning progress during college coursework
